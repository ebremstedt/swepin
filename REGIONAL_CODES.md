## Regional Codes in Swedish Personal Identity Numbers

For people born before 1990, the first two digits of the birth number (positions 7-8 in the full personal identity number) indicated the county (län) where the person was registered at birth or when immigrating to Sweden. After January 1, 1990, these digits no longer have geographical significance and are assigned randomly.

### County Code Table (Historical for births before 1990)

| Code Range | County (Län) | Main City/Region |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| 00-13      | Stockholm    | Stockholm        |
| 14-15      | Uppsala      | Uppsala          |
| 16-18      | Södermanland | Nyköping         |
| 19-23      | Östergötland | Linköping        |
| 24-26      | Jönköping    | Jönköping        |
| 27-28      | Kronoberg    | Växjö            |
| 29-31      | Kalmar       | Kalmar           |
| 32         | Gotland      | Visby            |
| 33-34      | Blekinge     | Karlskrona       |
| 35-38      | Kristianstad | Kristianstad     |
| 39-45      | Malmöhus     | Malmö            |
| 46-47      | Halland      | Halmstad         |
| 48-54      | Göteborg och Bohus | Gothenburg |
| 55-58      | Älvsborg     | Vänersborg       |
| 59-61      | Skaraborg    | Skara            |
| 62-64      | Värmland     | Karlstad         |
| 65-68      | Örebro       | Örebro           |
| 69-70      | Västmanland  | Västerås         |
| 71-73      | Kopparberg (Dalarna) | Falun    |
| 74-77      | Gävleborg    | Gävle            |
| 78-81      | Västernorrland | Härnösand      |
| 82-84      | Jämtland     | Östersund        |
| 85-88      | Västerbotten | Umeå             |
| 89-92      | Norrbotten   | Luleå            |
| 93-99      | Special codes | Foreign-born    |

### Special Considerations

1. **Post-1990 Assignment**: For individuals born after January 1, 1990, these digits are assigned randomly without geographical significance.

2. **Foreign-Born Individuals**: Historically, individuals born outside Sweden were often assigned codes in the 93-99 range.

3. **County Reorganizations**: Some county borders have changed over time. The codes reflect the county organization at the time of registration.

4. **Information Privacy**: Since these codes can reveal a person's place of birth, they are considered personal information. This is one reason why the system changed in 1990.

### Example

For a personal identity number `19501122-4591`:
- Birth date: November 22, 1950
- Birth number: `459`
- Regional code: `45` indicates the person was registered in Malmöhus county (now part of Skåne)

### Modern Usage

In modern Swedish personal identity numbers (for people born after 1990), these digits serve only as part of the unique identifier and have no geographical meaning. The randomization of these digits was implemented as a privacy measure and to ensure a sufficient supply of available numbers.

This historical regional coding is an interesting aspect of the Swedish personal identity number system, providing a glimpse into the person's geographical origins for those born before 1990.
